# Applied-Databases
project as part of Applied Databases module


The project brief was to create a python project that could read and write data to both neo4j and SQL databases that were provided. 

This brief is also included in the repository to view, if desired. 

The project requires the user to have both mySQL and neo4j available on the local machine. There may also be some modiifications required within the code, particularly with regards the drivers on both python files. 


There are some areas of this code that are not working correctly-this was primarily down to time constraints that unfortunately prevented further research to find a correct solution
